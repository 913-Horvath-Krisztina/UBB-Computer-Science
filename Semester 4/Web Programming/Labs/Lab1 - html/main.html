        <p title="Latest news"> On Sunday, <b>Max Verstappen</b> took victory in the season opening Bahrain Grand Prix at the ninth time of asking while Red Bull picked up a one-two thanks to Sergio Perez – and the reigning champion was clearly elated at his winning start.
            Verstappen led from lights out, swapping his starting set of softs for another set on Lap 14 before switching to hards on Lap 36, to win the Bahrain Grand Prix by 11 seconds over team mate Perez. The two-time champion never looked threatened for the lead, and now has 25 points to his tally as he seeks a third title.</p>
