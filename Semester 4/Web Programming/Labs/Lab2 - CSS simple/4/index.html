        <p>Cats and dogs are the most popular pets in the world. Cats are more independent and are generally cheaper and less demanding pets. Dogs are loyal and obedient but require more attention and exercise, including regular walks.</p>

<!--    <p id="underline"> When choosing between a cat or a dog, you should consider how much time you can dedicate to the pet (dogs require more time than cats, and donâ€™t like to be left home alone), how much you can afford to spend (dogs are more expensive than cats), and what temperament of pet you would before (dogs are more needy and affectionate than independent cats).</p>-->
