;Given the words A and B, compute the word C as follows:
;- the bits 0-2 of C are the same as the bits 10-12 of B
;- the bits 3-6 of C have the value 1
;- the bits 7-10 of C are the same as the bits 1-4 of A
;- the bits 11-12 have the value 0
;- the bits 13-15 of C are the invert of the bits 9-11 of B

; We will obtain the word C by successive "isolation" of bits sequences. The isolation
; of the bits 10-12 of B is done by obtaining the unchanged values of these bits,  
; and initialising all other bits to 0. The isolation operation can be performed
; using the operator AND between the word B and the mask
; 0001110000000000. Once isolated, the sequence of bits is put on the right  position by using a rotation operation. 
; The final word is obtained by applying the operator OR between all intermediate results obtained by using isolations and rotations.

; Observation: bits are numbered from right to left
