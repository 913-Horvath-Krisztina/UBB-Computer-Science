R1
10. a.Determine the number formed by adding all even elements and subtractingall odd numbers of the list.
b. Determine difference of two sets represented as lists.

P1
5.a. Write a predicate to compute the union of two sets.
b. Write a predicate to determine the set of all the pairs of elements in a list. 
Eg.: L = [a b c d] =>[[a b] [a c] [a d] [b c] [b d] [c d]].

P2
12.a. Define a predicate to add after every element from a list, the divisors of that number.
b. For a heterogeneous list, formed from integer numbers and list of numbers, 
define a predicate to add in every sublist the divisors of every element.
Eg.: [1, [2, 5, 7], 4, 5, [1, 4], 3, 2, [6, 2, 1], 4, [7, 2, 8, 1], 2] =>
[1, [2, 5, 7], 4, 5, [1, 4, 2], 3, 2, [6, 2, 3, 2, 1], 4, [7, 2, 8, 2, 4, 1], 2]

P3 1. Write a predicate to generate the list of all subsets with all elements of a given list. 
 Eg: [2, 3, 4] N=2 => [[2,3],[2,4],[3,4]]
